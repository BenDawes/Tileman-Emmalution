This is SpicyKai's Tileman Challenge!

Most of the world is restricted behind tiles,
and if you want to use them--or even get to Pierre's, you must buy my tiles!

This mod was inspired by Setlled's Runescape Tileman challenge on Youtube, 
Check him out here: https://www.youtube.com/c/Settledrs/featured

Here is a short explanation for the values used in the config.json (There are seperate config.json files for each save for progression purposes)


ToPlaceTiles: 
Tells the mod whether or not to put down tiles in each location,
true -> generates tiles,
false -> do not generate

DoCollision:
Does the mod check if you collide with tiles?
true -> Stop player from crossing them, 
false -> Allows free-roaming

ToggleOverlay: 
true -> See the tiles,
false -> Hide the tiles

TilePrice: 
How much each tile costs to purchase

TilePriceRaise:
How much the price of tile incrases with each purchase,
The default raise is set to something very low so tile increases happen very infrequently

CavernsExtra
How many extra levels of Skull Caverns do you want to have tiles in? 
The default goes down to floor 100

DifficultyMode
0 -> Tile prices increase as normal,
1 -> Tile price increase by 1 every 10x tiles purchased (10,100,1000...),
2 -> Every single tile purchased increases the price by 1
